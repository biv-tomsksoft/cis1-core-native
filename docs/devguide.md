# cis1 core development guide

## Common rules

The core consists of many executables described in [cis1-docs](https://github.com/tomsksoft-llc/cis1-docs). It can have additional executables if needed, for example `cis_cron_daemon` which is not described in docs and used only for service purpose.

Every executable should return exitcode zero in case of success and non-zero in other cases.

If execution fails, process should print a diagnostic message in stderr and also to one of logs, usually `cis_log`.

`cis_log` is for cis-wide events, like a start of a new session, some critical error.

`session_log` should include in itself all session events and errors. It should help in tracking errors in user scripts.

`webui_log` shouldn't be used separately in most cases. All writes to `cis_log` and `session_log` automatically sends data to `webui_log` too.

`tee_log` write to all logs.

## Repository structure

`include` - C++ header files.

`src` - C++ source files.

`cmake` - CMake scripts.

`test_package` - unit tests.

`docs` - additional documentation.

`version.txt` - package version.

## Backwards compatibility

Every executable must be backward compatible at least in one major version.

Itâ€™s about return codes and event stdout and stderr messages, which either can be used for user's diagnostic or parsed for some further processing.

## Contributing

Follow [the GitHub pull request workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/): fork, branch, commit, pull request, automated tests, review, merge.

* Do PR only to dev branch.
* Every PR must have issue associated with it.
* Try to write smaller commits, that do exactly one thing.
* Commit message should briefly describe changes in code.
* Try to cover your code with unit tests.
* For extra code-health changes, either file a separate issue, or make it a separate PR that can be easily reviewed.
* Add reviewer to pull request.

Code style for C++ code can be found on [this](https://github.com/tomsksoft-llc/cis1-webui-native-srv-cpp/wiki/Codestyle "C++ CodeStyle") wiki-page.

## External libraries

External libraries usage is allowed, but you should check license compatibility.

## Documentation

Every class, function, method should be documented with doxygen.
